# Web-scraping_of_Quotes.
This is a simple web scraping script where I scrape quotes along with the names of the people who gave those quotes, and save the data in an Excel sheet.
I have used python , BeautifulSoup, requests to Scrape the data.
I used the Pandas library to write and save the collected data.
