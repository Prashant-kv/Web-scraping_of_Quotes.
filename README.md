# Webscraping of Quotes

This is a simple web scraping script where I scrape quotes along with the names of the people who gave those quotes, and save the data in an Excel sheet. I have used python , BeautifulSoup, requests to Scrape the data. I used the Pandas library to write and save the collected data.




## How this project is useful:



- The script automates the process of gathering quotes and their associated authors from websites, saving time compared to manual collection.
- Storing data in an Excel sheet allows for further analysis, such as finding patterns in the quotes, grouping them by author.
- The script can be reused to scrape other similar websites with minimal adjustments, allowing for flexible and scalable data collection.
